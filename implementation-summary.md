# Skills Management Implementation Summary

## Problem
The user reported an issue where deleted skills in the recruitment portal were reappearing after page refresh. This was happening because the skills management page was using hardcoded skills data in component state rather than persisting changes to a database.

## Solution
To fix this issue, we implemented a complete database-backed skills management system:

### 1. Database Model
- Added a `skills` model in the Prisma schema with fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
  - `name`: Skill name (unique)
  - `description`: Optional description
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for creation
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp for updates

### 2. API Endpoints
Created RESTful API endpoints for skills management:
- `GET /api/admin/skills` - List all skills
- `POST /api/admin/skills` - Create a new skill
- `GET /api/admin/skills/[id]` - Get a specific skill
- `PUT /api/admin/skills/[id]` - Update a skill
- `DELETE /api/admin/skills/[id]` - Delete a skill

### 3. Frontend Integration
Updated the skills management page (`src/pages/admin/administration/skills.tsx`) to:
- Fetch skills from the API on component mount
- Add loading states for better UX
- Connect the add/edit/delete functions to the API endpoints
- Implement proper error handling and success messages

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Enhanced the AlertBox component to support confirmation dialogs for delete operations
- Added form validation for required fields
- Implemented success/error notifications for user actions

## Result
With these changes, the skills management system now properly persists all changes to the database. When a skill is deleted, it's permanently removed from the database, so it won't reappear when the page is refreshed.

## Technical Details
- The implementation uses Next.js API routes for the backend
- Prisma ORM is used for database interactions
- The frontend uses React hooks for state management
- API requests are made using the fetch API
